# react-redux booking sample

Client is largely responsive and has been tested across multiple devices via Google Chrome. Layout is largely consistent across all displays.
Thank you flexbox for making the responsiveness of the search bar a breeze (width based layout was not scaling consitently).

```
➜ cd client
➜ npm install
➜ npm start
```

Bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
